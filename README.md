## Step1. Azure CLI Info Gathering (Only for Azure Database for PostgreSQL Single Servers)
1. Download the package zip file named `PostgreSQL-Info-Gather.zip`
2. Extract the `unzip PostgreSQL-Info-Gather.zip` file.
3. Run `rename rename.txt rename.bat` and Execute the `rename.bat` ( Windows ) 
4. Run `sh ./rename-linux.txt` ( Linux )
5. Open the Input file `Azure_Subscription.csv` and provide the Tenant ID & Subscription ID 
6. Execute `powershell.exe .\CMF-PostgreSQL-CLI-Windows.ps1` (Windows)
7. Execute `pwsh ./CMF-PostgreSQL-CLI-Linux.ps1` (Linux)
8. Once the execution completed, you can check the output & Logs folder.

## Step2. Update CMF_PostgreSQL_Server_Input_file.csv (For All Servers)
 "**Host_Name**","Resource_Group","**Port**","VCore","Auth_Type","**User_ID**","**Password**","**DB_Name**","Tenant","Subscription_ID","**Approval_Status**","**SSL_Mode**"

**Note:-**<br />
. Highlighted are **Mandatory Fields**<br />
. Update Mandatory fields manually in case of Azure VM / On-premises / Other Cloud Servers <br />
. If a **Password** is not provided, this requires interactive console input of the password for each server. <br />

## Step3. PostgreSQL Server Info Gathering (For All Servers)
1. Execute `powershell.exe .\CMF-PostgreSQL-Windows.ps1` ( Windows )
2. Execute `pwsh ./CMF-PostgreSQL-Linux.ps1` ( Linux )
3. Once the execution completed, you can check the output & Logs folder.

## Step4. Azure VM/On-premises Servers  (Only for On-Premises / Azure VM / Other Cloud Servers)
. Refer document `CMF-ON-Prem_Server_Info_gather.docx` from the zip folder and update details and share document.<br />

Host-Name  | Cores | Memory | Storage Size | Storage Type | OS type | OS version | IOPS 

## Step5. Zip and share output, log folders (For All Servers) 
Kindly follow the execution instructions mentioned in attached documents.
